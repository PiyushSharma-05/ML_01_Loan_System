CreditWise: Loan Approval Prediction System

An end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline designed to automate and predict loan eligibility using historical applicant data. This project explores the trade-offs between precision and recall in a financial risk context.

🚀 Overview
Dataset: 1,000 entries with 20 features (Income, Credit Score, DTI Ratio, etc.)

Goal: Binary classification of Loan_Approved (Yes/No).

Key Challenge: Handling missing data (5% per column) and optimizing for risk-sensitive metrics.

🛠️ Technical Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing & EDA
Imputation: Used SimpleImputer with mean for numerical and most_frequent for categorical missing values.

Visualization: Detailed analysis using Seaborn (Heatmaps, Boxplots, and Pie charts) to identify correlations between Credit_Score, DTI_Ratio, and approval rates.

Encoding: Implemented LabelEncoder for ordinal data and OneHotEncoder (drop='first') for nominal features.

2. Feature Engineering
Non-linear Transformations: Created polynomial features (DTI_Ratio_sq, Credit_Score_sq) to capture complex relationships.

Scaling: Applied StandardScaler to ensure distance-based models (KNN) and gradient-based models (Logistic Regression) perform optimally.

3. Model Performance
I compared three distinct algorithms to evaluate the "Precision vs. Recall" trade-off:

Model	              Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	  88%	    0.79	    0.80	0.80
Gaussian Naive Bayes  86%	    0.78	    0.77	0.78
K-Nearest Neighbors	  76%   	0.62	    0.51    0.56

📈 Key Insight
Logistic Regression emerged as the superior model for this dataset, achieving a balanced F1-score of 0.80. While Gaussian NB remained competitive, the engineered features helped Logistic Regression better distinguish between high-risk and low-risk applicants.
